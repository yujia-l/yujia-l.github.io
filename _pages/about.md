<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm Yujia Liu, an HCI student researcher passionate about Human-AI Interaction and Affective Computing. Currently, I'm pursuing my M.A. in Information Art and Design at the Future Lab of Tsinghua University, under the advisory of Prof. [Yingqing Xu](https://thfl.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yjdw/yjtd/xyq/index.htm) and Prof. [Chun Yu](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/ChunYu/). 

My academic journey began with undergraduate degrees in Automation Engineering and Industrial Design, laying a dual foundation that marries technical precision with aesthetic innovation. My work embodies this cross-disciplinary fusion, particularly evident in projects ranging from AR-enhanced smart mirrors, LLM-based digital well-being management, to 3D LEGO design generations. Each project reflects my commitment to leveraging a blend of engineering precision and design sensitivity, aiming to create technologies that are not only efficient and functional but also accessible and engaging for users.

[3D-Mirrorcle: Bridging the Virtual and Real through Depth Alignment in Smart Mirror Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.13617.pdf)

**Yujia Liu**, Qi Xin, Chenzhuo Xiang, Yu Zhang, Yingqing Xu.
- In submission to the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST), 2024.
- TLDR: An innovative smart mirror system integrating AR with real-world reflections, addressing depth disparity via a lenticular grating setup, with real-time image adjustment and position adaptation algorithms to align AR content with the user's depth perception and enhance interaction realism. Demonstrated through a makeup application prototype with significant improvements in accuracy (11.1% ‚Üë), task completion time (47.9% ‚Üì), and user satisfaction (44.4% ‚Üë) compared to the existing systems.
