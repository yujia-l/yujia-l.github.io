abstract: Mirrors are ubiquitous in our daily lives. As technology advances in the recent decade, smart mirrors that combine reflective surfaces with screens have emerged to enhance people's interaction with mirrors. However, this approach engenders a problem of depth incongruity, obstructing the simultaneous perception of oneâ€™s 3D reflection in the mirror and the 2D display on the screen, significantly impairing the user experience of smart mirrors. To address this depth disparity and achieve seamless mirror-based augmented reality (AR) with better integration of screen content and mirror imaging, we present an innovative system named 3D-Mirrorcle. Our system utilizes a cylindrical grating between the screen and the half-mirror. Together with real-time eye tracking and image alignment algorithms to match the disparity between the left and right views with that of both eyes, our system achieves two major breakthroughs ':' glasses-free 3D display and mirror-AR alignment. To validate the effectiveness of 3D-Mirrorcle, we implemented a prototype that projects AR contours onto the user's face. 36 participants were invited to engage in a hands-on trial and provide feedback through interviews. The findings from our user study highlight that our system outperforms various other mirror AR technologies in terms of usability, immersion, and satisfaction. These encouraging results underscore the immense potential of our method as a pivotal technology in truly bringing AR to life.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
 summary: 3D-Mirrorcle is an innovative technology that enables depth-matched AR display on a mirror surface. By utilizing lenticular gratings and real-time image algorithms, it creates binocular disparity, allowing the AR content to seamlessly blend with the mirror space, resulting in a truly immersive experience.
